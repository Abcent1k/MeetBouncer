# Meet Bouncer: Google Meet Auto-Exit Extension
Now is available on Chrome Web Store! [Extension Link](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/meetbouncer-google-meet-a/gkgibfogonflljeafffchiinbjohhnij).

This extension is designed to enhance your Google Meet experience by automatically exiting the meeting when the number of participants reaches or falls below a predefined threshold. The number of participants is checked every 5 seconds.

## Features
- **Automatic Exit:** Leave the meeting automatically based on participant count.
- **Active Tab Indicator:** The extension icon changes from green to orange to indicate inactivity, as it operates only on active tabs.
- **Compatibility with Volume Control Extensions:** When used alongside volume control extensions, it remains functional even on inactive tabs, giving you the freedom to browse without having to keep the Meet tab open.
- **Push Notifications:** Informs about the extension's activity, which can be toggled off in settings located at the top right corner of the extension window.

## Usage
1) Set your desired participant threshold in the extension.
2) Ensure that the extension is active (green icon) while on the Meet tab.
3) To maintain functionality on inactive tabs, activate a volume control extension on the Meet tab.
