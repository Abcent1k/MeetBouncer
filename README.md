# Meet Bouncer: Google Meet Auto-Exit Extension
Available on Chrome Web Store! [Extension Link](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/meetbouncer-google-meet-a/gkgibfogonflljeafffchiinbjohhnij).

Available on Firefox ADD-ONS! [Extension Link](https://addons.mozilla.org/uk/firefox/addon/meetbouncer/).

This extension is designed to enhance your Google Meet experience by automatically exiting the meeting when the number of participants falls below a predefined threshold. The number of participants is checked every 2 seconds. It also supports automatic departure from Google Meet through a timer or schedule.

## Features
- **Flexible Exit Options:** Exit meetings based on participant count, timer, or a predefined schedule.
- **Active Tab Indicator:** The extension icon changes from green to orange to indicate inactivity, as it operates only on active tabs.
- **Compatibility with Volume Control Extensions:** When used alongside volume control extensions, it remains functional even on inactive tabs, giving you the freedom to browse without having to keep the Meet tab open.
- **Push Notifications:** Informs about the extension's activity, which can be toggled off in settings located at the top right corner of the extension window.

## Usage
1) Set your desired participant threshold in the extension.
2) Ensure that the extension is active (green icon) while on the Meet tab.
3) To maintain functionality on inactive tabs, activate a volume control extension on the Meet tab.
